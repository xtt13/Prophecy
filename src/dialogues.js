			'Hello? Are you okay?',
			'My name is Lucy! Pleased to meet you! Uh...',
			'Levi! Alright.',
			'This? It\'s the Forest of Eritel! You seem to \nbe lost. There is a village nearby, just \nfollow the path!',
			'Though! It must be scary around here for someone \nwho isn\'t familiar with these woods! ',
			'How about that: \nI\'ll stay with you for now, Levi!'
		],

		//
		2: [
			'Oh, seems like the path is falling apart! There \nare platforms you can reach by using \nthe [BUTTON].',
			'You should give it a try!'		
		],

		3: [
			'Great! You did it! Make sure you don\'t forget \nit, it can save your life.'
		],

		// Enter Map Dialogue
		4: [
			'The monsters around here are quite destructive!\nI\'m surprised none took advantage of you when \nyou passed out! Seems like today is your lucky \nday.',
			'The Forest of Eritel wasn\'t always like this, \nit was home of a great civilization once! Hence \nwhy sometimes you can find treasures, chests and other \nsecrets when you look around closely.',
			'Always pay attention to your surroundings.'
		],

		// Bridge Dialogue
		5: [
			'Oh, right! The villagers of Aalis use many \nmechanisms to keep the monsters out of their \ntown. This is one of said mechanisms.',
			'To continue, you have to explore a little, \nmaybe you can find a way to activate \nthe bridge again.'	
		],

		// Chest Dialogue
		6: [
			'There we go! Seems like they locked up the \nitem that could help us reactivate the bridge \nin this treasure chest!',
			'... What are you waiting for? \nYou think you can just open it? \nThis isn\'t a video game, Levi.',
			'You have to pick the lock! Oh, one more thing! \nIf you fail three times, the chests will close \ntheir locks for a short period of time.',
			'So if you mess up, you have to wait for a bit \nuntil you can try again.'
		],

		//
		7: [
			'Oh no! Do you see this? These are the monsters I\'ve been talking about! Seems like there is no way around. We have to get down there and fight.',
			'... You don\'t have a weapon? No worries! I will lend you my powers! I can not use them myself because my form is too weak right now, but you can! All you have to do is press [BUTTON]. The best way to learn how to fight is to fight! You got this!',
			'Quick, we should leave this place, or else we might be surrounded by monsters again in no time.',
			'We\'re almost there! Aalis is right over there...'
		],

		//
		8: [
			'One last thing before we enter the village! You will encounter many different people! Maybe they can help you figure out why you ended up here. But to do so, you will have to talk to the them. Use the [BUTTON] to interact with the towns folks.',
			'... Another thing! Especially the high priest and the priestess don\'t like monsters. Since I, too, look like one, it will probably be for the best if I stayed invisible and silent during our stay in the village. You can still use my powers, but I will not be able to interact with you, Levi. Be careful, young hero.'
