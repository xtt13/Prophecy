			'My name is Lucy! Pleased to meet you! Uh...',
			'Levi! Alright.',
			'This? It\'s the Forest of Eritel! You seem to \nbe lost. There is a village nearby, just \nfollow the path!',
			'Though! It must be scary around here for someone \nwho isn\'t familiar with these woods! ',
			'How about that: \nI\'ll stay with you for now, Levi!'

			'Oh, seems like the path is falling apart! There \nare platforms you can reach by using the [BUTTON].',
			'You should give it a try!',
			'Great! You did it! Make sure you don\'t forget \nit, it can save your life.'

			'The monsters around here are quite destructive!\nI\'m surprised none took advantage of you when \nyou passed out! Seems like today is your lucky \nday.',
			'The Forest of Eritel wasn\'t always like this, \nit was home of a great civilization once! Hence \nwhy sometimes you can find treasures, chests and other \nsecrets when you look around closely.',
			'Always pay attention to your surroundings.'

			'Oh, right! The villagers of Aalis use many mechanisms to keep the monsters out of their town. This is one of said mechanisms. To continue, you have to explore a little, maybe you can find a way to activate the bridge again.',
			'There we go! Seems like they locked up the item that could help us reactivate the bridge in this treasure chest!',
			'... What are you waiting for? You think you can just open it? This isn\'t a video game, Levi. You have to pick the lock! Oh, one more thing! If you fail three times, the chests will close their locks for a few seconds/short period of time. So if you mess up, you have to wait for a bit until you can try again.'

		5: [
			'Oh no! Do you see this? These are the monsters I\'ve been talking about! Seems like there is no way around. We have to get down there and fight.',
			'... You don\'t have a weapon? No worries! I will lend you my powers! I can not use them myself because my form is too weak right now, but you can! All you have to do is press [BUTTON]. The best way to learn how to fight is to fight! You got this!',
			'Quick, we should leave this place, or else we might be surrounded by monsters again in no time.',
			'We\'re almost there! Aalis is right over there...'
		],

		6: [
			'One last thing before we enter the village! You will encounter many different people! Maybe they can help you figure out why you ended up here. But to do so, you will have to talk to the them. Use the [BUTTON] to interact with the towns folks.',
			'... Another thing! Especially the high priest and the priestess don\'t like monsters. Since I, too, look like one, it will probably be for the best if I stayed invisible and silent during our stay in the village. You can still use my powers, but I will not be able to interact with you, Levi. Be careful, young hero.'
