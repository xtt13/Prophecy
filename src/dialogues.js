			'The monsters around here are quite destructive!\nI\'m surprised none took advantage of you when \nyou passed out! Seems like today is your lucky \nday.',
			'The Forest of Eritel wasn\'t always like this, \nit was home of a great civilization once! Hence \nwhy sometimes you can find treasures, chests \nand other secrets when you look around closely.',

			'Oh, right! The villagers of Aalis use many \nmechanisms to keep the monsters out of their \ntown. This is one of said mechanisms.',

			'... What are you waiting for? \nDo you think you can just open it?',
			'You have to pick the lock by pressing the \nE-Key!', 'Oh, one more thing! \nIf you fail three times, the chests will close \ntheir locks for a short period of time.',
			'So if you mess up, you have to wait for a bit \nuntil you can try again.'

			'All you have to do is press the left \nMouse-Button. The best way to learn how to \nfight is to fight! You got this!',
			'Quick, we should leave this place, or else \nwe might be surrounded by monsters again in \nno time.',

			'One last thing before we enter the village! \nYou will encounter many different people! \nMaybe they can help you figure out \nwhy you ended up here.', 'But to do so, you will have to talk to the them. \nUse the E-Key to interact with the towns \nfolks.',
			'Another thing! Especially the high priest and \nthe priestess don\'t like monsters. ', 'Since I, too, look like one, it will \nprobably be for the best if I stayed invisible \nand silent during our stay in the village.','You can still use my powers, but I will not \nbe able to interact with you, Levi. \nBe careful, young hero.'
